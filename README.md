# Survival Shooter — FMOD Audio Integration Project

A 3D survival shooter game (based on Unity's official tutorial) with **all audio removed**. Your task is to implement a complete audio design using FMOD.

The game features a player fighting waves of enemies (ZomBear, ZomBunny, Hellephant) with raycast-based shooting, health management, and scoring. Everything works — it's just silent.

## Requirements

- **Unity 6** version **6000.3.7f1** (must match exactly)
- **FMOD for Unity** plugin (install after forking)

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork the Repository

1. Go to [github.com/danielrdehaan/unity-survival-shooter](https://github.com/danielrdehaan/unity-survival-shooter)
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner
3. Select your own GitHub account as the destination
4. This creates your own copy of the project that you can modify freely

### 2. Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/unity-survival-shooter.git
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

### 3. Install Unity 6000.3.7f1

1. Open **Unity Hub**
2. Go to **Installs** and check if version **6000.3.7f1** is listed
3. If not, click **Install Editor**, find **6000.3.7f1** under Unity 6 releases, and install it
4. If you cannot find the exact version in the Hub, use the [Unity Archive](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive) to locate the install link for **6000.3.7f1**

> **Important:** You must use this exact version. Opening the project with a different version may cause import errors or unexpected behavior.

### 4. Open the Project

1. In Unity Hub, click **Open** (or **Add project from disk**)
2. Navigate to the cloned `unity-survival-shooter` folder and select it
3. Make sure Unity Hub selects editor version **6000.3.7f1** for this project
4. Wait for the project to import (first open may take a few minutes)

### 5. Open the Game Scene

1. In the Project window, navigate to `Assets/_CompletedAssets/Scenes/`
2. Double-click **Complete-Game** to open it
3. Press **Play** to verify the game runs (you should see enemies spawning, shooting works — just no sound)

## Project Structure

```
Assets/
├── Scripts/                    # Gameplay scripts (Player, Enemy, Managers)
├── _CompletedAssets/
│   ├── Scenes/Complete-Game.unity   # Main game scene
│   ├── Prefabs/                     # Player, ZomBunny, ZomBear, Hellephant
│   └── Scripts/                     # Completed tutorial scripts
```

## What Was Removed

All Unity audio has been stripped from this project:

- AudioSource components from all prefabs and scene objects
- AudioClip references from all scripts
- Audio asset files (sound effects, music)
- AudioMixer and AudioMixerSnapshot configurations
- Audio-specific scripts (MixLevels, VolumeHandler)
- The BackgroundMusic GameObject from the scene

The AudioListener on the Main Camera has been kept — it won't conflict with FMOD's StudioListener.

## Gameplay Events to Design Audio For

- Player shooting (gunfire)
- Player taking damage (hurt)
- Player death
- Enemy taking damage (per enemy type: ZomBear, ZomBunny, Hellephant)
- Enemy death (per enemy type)
- Background music / ambience
- UI interactions (pause, game over)
